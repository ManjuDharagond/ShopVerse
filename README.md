# 🛍️ ShopVerse

A full-stack MERN e-commerce platform evolving into a **scalable, analytics-driven, ML-powered** system.  
This project is not just an online store—it’s my learning playground for modern web development, data-driven insights, and applied machine learning.

---

## 🚀 Vision
To build a production-grade e-commerce application that grows step by step:
- From a basic MERN stack app
- → to an analytics platform
- → to an ML-driven recommendation engine
- → to a scalable microservices architecture

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (Vite, Redux Toolkit/Context), TailwindCSS, Recharts
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **Payments:** Stripe / Razorpay
- **Analytics:** Event tracking, dashboards (Chart.js / Recharts)
- **ML (Future Phases):** TensorFlow.js, TensorFlow (Python microservice)
- **Infra (Future Phases):** Docker, Kubernetes, Redis, Kafka, Prometheus/Grafana

# 🌿 Git Branch Setup  

To keep things clean, let’s create a **new branch just for docs** and push it to GitHub.  

### Commands:
```bash
# make sure you’re in your repo root
git checkout -b docs/readme

# add the README.md file
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: add initial README.md with vision and roadmap"

# push branch to GitHub
git push origin docs/readme


Now you’ll have a separate branch (docs/readme) for your README. Later, you can merge it into main via PR.
